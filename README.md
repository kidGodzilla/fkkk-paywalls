# fkkk-paywalls

1. See a paywall? Too many ads? Annoying popups? Outline it instead!
2. Each time you use Outline, we'll ask if you want to always use Outline on a site.
3. Skip straight to the Outline the next time you click a link on a site that uses paywalls.

## Installation

1. Download the extension as a ZIP file.
2. Install it to Chrome, using Developer Mode.

Here's a good guide for installing a chrome extension from source:

## Todos

[ ] Currently, there's no way to remove a site from the bypass list (unless you're a developer). I'll change that.
[ ] If you visit the homepage of a site that uses paywalls the extension shouldn't try to "outline" it.


## About

I got sick of clicking links that result in a paywall or a nagging ad. Spent 20 minutes to create an extension to just stop visiting those sites altogether.

This is a fork of https://github.com/ymolodtsov/outline with a few extra features.
