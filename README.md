# Fkk Paywalls

I got sick of clicking links that result in a paywall or a nagging ad. Spent 20 minutes to create an extension to just stop visiting those sites altogether.

1. See a paywall? Too many ads? Annoying popups? [Outline](https://outline.com/) it instead!
2. Each time you use [Outline](https://outline.com/), we'll ask if you want to always use [Outline](https://outline.com/) on a site.
3. Skip straight to the [Outline](https://outline.com/) the next time you click a link on a site that uses paywalls.

## Why isn't this on the Chrome Web Store?

Google has a policy for what is and isn't allowed on the Chrome Web Store. Unfortunately, they seem to twist this policy to ban any extension that helps users bypass paywalls, or reduce you exposure to certain types of advertising. 

This may or may not be related to Google's primary source of revenue (advertising).


## Installation

1. Download the extension as a ZIP file.
2. Install it to Chrome, using Developer Mode.

Here's a good guide for installing a chrome extension from source:

## Todos

* [ ] Currently, there's no way to remove a site from the bypass list (unless you're a developer). I'll change that.
* [ ] If you visit the homepage of a site that uses paywalls the extension shouldn't try to "outline" it.


## About

This is a fork of https://github.com/ymolodtsov/outline with a few extra features.
